I worked with DOTS in the intended way to, to my ability, optimize my game. Wherever possible, I used [BurstCompile] to let that code be compiled directly to machine code, which is faster. Additionally, the fact that I used primarily structs, with the exception of the input system, and that structs are allocated on the stack in C#, meant that the code was able to run far faster, as the stack is way faster than the heap.
